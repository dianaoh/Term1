i'm dreaming of a dark christmas 
just like the ones i used to know 
where the tree tops lifeless 
and children listen 
to hear sleigh bells in the ash oh the ash 
i said i'm dreaming of a dark christmas 
with every christmas card i write 
may your days be gloomy and pale 
and may all your christmas be dark
